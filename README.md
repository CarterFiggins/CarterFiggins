### Hi, I'm Carter Figgins

I love creating things that make life easier, like a mountain bike weather report that tells me the best time to ride. I also enjoy programming Discord bots, with my favorite being a narrator for the game Werewolf. Right now, I'm learning Ruby on Rails by building a personal budgeting tool. It'll connect with banks through Plaid to track transactions and account info.
