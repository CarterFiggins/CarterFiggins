### Hi, I'm Carter Figgins

I like making useful things, like a [mountain bike weather report](https://github.com/CarterFiggins/MTB_Forecast) that tells me the best time to ride. I also enjoy programming Discord bots, with my favorite being a [narrator for the game Werewolf](https://github.com/CarterFiggins/werewolfBot). Right now, I am honing my skills in Ruby on Rails by building a personal budgeting tool. It will connect with banks through Plaid to track transactions and account info.
